## Introduction
This project implements a Cloud-Enabled Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system using the ESP32-CAM for smart surveillance applications. It features real-time vehicle detection, OCR-based license plate recognition, and cloud integration for data storage and remote access, enabling applications like automated toll collection and parking management.

## Features
Real-Time Vehicle Detection – Captures and processes vehicle images instantly

OCR-Based License Plate Recognition – Extracts and deciphers license plate numbers using Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

Cloud Integration – Stores vehicle data securely in the cloud for remote access and scalability

Automated Data Logging – Saves recognized license plates in a cloud database

Remote Monitoring & Access – Enables users to access and manage data from anywhere via cloud

Smart Surveillance Applications – Supports automated toll collection, parking management, and restricted area monitoring

Cost-Effective & Scalable – Utilizes low-cost hardware with cloud services for flexible expansion.
